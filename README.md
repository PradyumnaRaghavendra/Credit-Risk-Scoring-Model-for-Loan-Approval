# Credit Risk Modeling Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building and training credit risk models to predict the likelihood of loan default or creditworthiness of applicants. It leverages a structured dataset (e.g., `application_train.csv`) and uses machine learning techniques to generate predictive models.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- argparse

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

To train the models, run the training script with the required arguments:

```bash
python src/train_models.py --data_path data/application_train.csv --output_dir models/
```

**Arguments:**

- `--data_path`: Path to the input CSV dataset file.
- `--output_dir`: Directory where the trained models will be saved.
- `--n_components` *(optional)*: Number of components to use in the model (default value if applicable).

---

## Description

- The script reads the dataset from the specified path.
- Performs necessary preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Trains one or more machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.).
- Saves the trained models in the specified output directory.

---

## Notes

- Ensure the dataset file is available at the given path.
- Create the output directory if it does not exist.
- You can modify hyperparameters or add new models by editing `train_models.py`.
